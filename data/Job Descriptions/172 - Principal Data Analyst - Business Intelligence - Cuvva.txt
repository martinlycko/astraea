We’ve sold 11 million + policies, and supported over 1 million drivers and we’re just getting started. We’re a world-class team of circa 100 people, passionate about solving our customers’ problems.

About the role:

We’re in search of a forward thinking and commercially driven Principal Data (Business Intelligence) Analyst to join our established team within the Pricing & BI divisions at Cuvva. 



In this unique role, you’ll report directly to our Director of Pricing & Data as a senior individual contributor. While this role is initially focused on your direct individual contributions, there are clear pathways for growth into people management as part of this role's natural progression.



As our newly defined Principal Data (Business Intelligence) Analyst, you’ll be at the forefront of our transition from a traditional, analysis-focused approach to an advanced Business Intelligence model. Leading initiatives to harness complex datasets, you’ll bring your hands-on experience within Data analytics or Data Science to drive our Business Intelligence strategy and realise Cuvva’s vision.



You’ll work closely with cross-functional teams, becoming a trusted partner to stakeholders in Marketing, Pricing, Finance, Product, Operations, and Customer Experience. With your natural curiosity and initiative, you’ll champion data-driven discussions, predict trends, offer market and data insights, and proactively coach stakeholders. You'll identify areas for improvement, suggest solutions, and anticipate new metrics that should be tracked, fostering a culture of insight and informed decision-making across Cuvva. 



At Cuvva, we believe in fostering diverse skill sets and experiences. That’s why we use the titles “Analyst” and “Scientist” interchangeably. This role is titled Principal Data Analyst but may be well-suited to candidates with experience as Data Scientists or overall Business Intelligence. If you have the expertise and drive for high-impact work in this space, we encourage you to apply.

Partnering with key stakeholders to define metrics, validate KPIs, and deliver data-driven insights that inform decision-making at all levels, with a key focus on C-Suite stakeholder management and engagement

Conducting data discovery in collaboration with Marketing, Pricing, Finance, Product, Operations and Customer experience teams, translating complex analyses into clear, impactful recommendations for improving customer experiences and driving commercial success 
Mentoring junior analysts and team members, setting best practices, and promoting a data-driven culture across the business

Have strong experience in A/B Testing and Experimentation techniques, both Frequentist and Bayesian

Have a track record of stakeholder management, being a master at communicating across a variety of mediums with a proactive approach to engaging and aligning with key business goals


It’s a bonus if you: 

Have a background in product or insurance analytics
Possess an Interest in advancing AI and Machine Learning within the business intelligence space
Have experience in managing large, cross-functional projects with diverse teams
