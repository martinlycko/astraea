Marketing Science Lead (Contract-to-Perm) - **Immediate Start 6 month FTC**



Own. Build. Transform.

Are you a marketing science expert who thrives on turning data into action? Do you want to build something impactful, not just analyse numbers? If you're comfortable with ambiguity, large-scale budgets, and making an immediate business impact, this could be the role for you.

What We're Looking For:

Marketing Science & Attribution Expertise – You’ve built and owned measurement models before.
B2B Marketing Experience – You understand marketing measurement for B2B platforms.
Proven Impact on Large Budgets – You’ve worked with big numbers (millions, not thousands) and can demonstrate ROI.
