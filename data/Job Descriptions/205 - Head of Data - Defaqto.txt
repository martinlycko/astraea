We are looking for a data product leader to define and develop the strategy and monetisation of our significant data assets. You will ensure the data powering our products (including ratings, insights and research tools used by financial institutions, advisers and consumers) continues to be market leading, robust and future proof.



 Essential Requirements:



 1. Experience sourcing and acquiring data from third party suppliers

 2. Significant experience driving and owning the strategy for data assets and data-driven products available to the market



You will lead activities to optimise our data sourcing, aggregation and governance and you will drive the evolution of Defaqto's data ecosystem to better serve the consumer and the financial services industry.



As the UK’s most trusted source of financial product and market intelligence, we give people everything they need to make smarter financial decisions. We amass financial data - analyse it objectively, remove bias and then we transform it into expert product ratings, reports, software, and state-of-the-art interfaces.



Defaqto Facts & Figures

• 3.6m product features analysed and updated by our teams

• £50bn of investments recommended through our financial planning software each year

• 30+ years of heritage in rating financial products

• 88% of consumers are more likely to purchase a Defaqto-rated product



The Role

This role focuses on developing and executing our strategy for acquiring, managing and monetising our data assets. This data powers our market-leading products, including Defaqto Ratings, Defaqto Data Services, and Defaqto Software (such as Engage, Matrix, and Compare).



Experience in a similar role is essential. Additional experience in data analytics and/or artificial intelligence would be advantageous.



Responsibilities

• Develop and oversee Defaqto’s data strategy, ensuring governance, standards, integration, and quality to support current and future products.

• Improve and standardise data collection processes, including evaluating existing and potential data suppliers.

• Collaborate with Product and Commercial teams to identify valuable new data sources, plan their acquisition, and integrate them into our systems.

• Establish a structured approach to assess and optimise data sets based on factors like growth potential, profitability, and brand impact.

• Manage relationships with key data suppliers, set quality standards and SLAs, and ensure compliance.

• Build and lead a data management team, providing mentorship and fostering growth within the function.



What you’ll need to succeed 

• Significant experience driving and owning the strategy for data assets and data-driven products available to the market.

• Demonstrable experience of developing and executing on data strategies that have driven real commercial value in the organisations they serve.

• Experience sourcing and acquiring data including managing third party data providers.

• Entrepreneurial skills with evidence of monetising existing or new data sources.

• Evidence that you're happy rolling your sleeves up - we're a small team so you will need to be great at the strategy and the "doing"!

• Strong communication skills and a solid track record of working across functions and managing wide stakeholder groups.



Location

This is a hybrid role where your base can be in our London or Haddenham offices. You'll be expected to be in the office a couple of times each week. Most of your internal stakeholders are based from the Haddenham office so you should be comfortable commuting to this location .
