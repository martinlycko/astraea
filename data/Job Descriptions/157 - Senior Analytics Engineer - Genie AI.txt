Transform how the legal industry operates with the way you use our data
Building all your own pipes, transformations and flows - working with a modern data stack of your choice (inc. dbt) to transform data into business value
Autonomously work from deep data analysis to providing strategic, commercial and customer insights

Your purpose in our mission

We’ve raised $17.8 million in Series A funding led by Google Ventures and joined by Khosla Ventures. They believe in our vision that the law should be accessible to everyone. We need you to enable a self-service data culture where teams can access insights independently.

Your manager and team

Our org structure is made up of pods with distinct areas of focus to keep us all working on the most impactful things for our customers all of the time. Some of our team members work across multiple pods. Our structure was conceived with impact, autonomy and velocity in mind and we'd love to share more with you throughout our interview process. Initially reporting to Alex Denne, our Head of Growth (PLG), you’ll be empowered to elevate Genie through the power of data. Both Alex and Nitish, our Co-Founder & CTO will collaborate with you and enable you when you need them to, and will inspire you to push yourself outside your comfort zone.

This Is What You’ll Be Doing

As a Senior Analytics Engineer at Genie AI you’ll get the chance to immerse yourself within the world of law, legal contracts and AI at a fast paced and autonomous start up. We’re big enough to disrupt the legaltech industry, but small enough that you can make a massive impact on the team. Some of your key day to day duties will include:

Design, build, and maintain the data models which power business insights
Develop metrics frameworks and dimensions that standardize how we measure business performance
Work with stakeholders across marketing, sales, product, and operations and machine learning to translate business questions into data solutions
Enable key stakeholders to share and present data insights across the business
Enabling robust experimental results that removes opinion from discussion - this will ensure high impact growth / work is done
Build and maintain a semantic layer that makes data accessible to non-technical users
Create documentation and training to enable self-service analytics across teams
Implement and maintain dbt models that transform our raw data into reliable, tested datasets
Help establish data governance and quality practices as we scale

This is how we’ll set you up for success and the outcomes we expect from you

Over your first 90 days you can expect us to help point you in the right direction to set you up for success. During the interview process we can talk you through a high level overview of your 90 day plan.

By the end of your first three months we expect you to be:

 Month 1: Understand business needs, audit data sources (Mixpanel, Segment, MongoDB, BQ etc.), map stakeholder requirements and develop a roadmap towards a simple but modern data stack. You’ll create a few high-value dashboards by working and playing with the data we already have.
 Month 2: Implement core data models in BigQuery (probably) or Snowflake/Databricks, creating initial dashboards, establish a metrics framework, and set up dbt transformations for key entities.
 Month 3: Enable self-service analytics, implement automated reverse ETL for marketing activation campaigns, refine dashboards based on feedback, and deliver actionable insights to growth, sales, finance and product stakeholders.

We’ll continually develop and measure success on the below criteria:

Insight Activation: Business decisions across growth, product, sales and strategy are consistently made using data from our analytics platform
Self-Service Analytics: Teams can answer their own data questions without your involvement using well-designed dashboards and data models
Single Customer View: Creation of a unified customer data model that connects behavior across platforms and enables personalization within both growth and marketing comms, and product/ML via AI
Metrics Standardization: Core business metrics are clearly defined, documented, and consistently calculated across the company (grey areas are known to everyone)
Data Culture: Increased use of data in decision-making, with more teams requesting access to and using analytics tools
Technical Foundation: Implementation of a sustainable, documented modern data stack that can evolve with our business needs

We are a start up in an exceptionally dynamic stage of our growth. We are a customer and employee led organisation. What this means is that we adapt to our customers' needs, and the problems we’re solving today could be very different in six months, or even by the end of this recruitment process. We also listen to our team as we empower you to have full autonomy of your role - you're the expert. You should expect to work with us on how your role develops, grows and changes throughout your time at Genie.

It can be tough here because

We don’t structure your work for you. We give you the what and you come up with the how
We don’t try to get things perfect the first time. We get things to ‘good enough’, and then we continuously iterate
This is a generalist analytics role - we need you to be good at a lot of data areas rather than specialising in one

But we think you’ll love

The autonomy and trust we give you to deliver your best work
Learning from some of the brightest minds in the field of AI
The exhilaration of a fast pace start up

The Skills You Need To Succeed In This Role

The ideal candidate will have 5 years+ experience and:

Advanced SQL: Expert-level SQL for complex data modeling and transformation
Data modeling/transformation: Strong experience with dbt for transforming raw data into analytics-ready datasets
Cloud data warehouses: Experience with BigQuery (preferred) or Snowflake/Redshift
Business communication: Proven ability to translate data insights into business outcomes
Data visualization: Experience creating intuitive dashboards that tell clear data stories
BI tools: Proficiency with modern tools like Looker, Holistics, PowerBI or Tableau 
Metrics definition: Experience defining standardized business metrics and dimensions
Python: Basic programming skills for data transformation and analysis 
Version control: Experience with Git for managing data transformation code
Product Analytics: Experience with tools like Segment, Snowplow, Mixpanel or Amplitude

Nice To Have

Cloud platforms: Familiarity with GCP (preferred) or AWS services 
Data quality: Experience with testing and validating data transformations 
ETL/ELT tools: Familiarity with tools like Fivetran or Stitch
Reverse ETL: Understanding of how to activate data in marketing tools

(Don’t worry about ticking every single box on the list to be considered for this role.)

The data challenges we'll solve together

We're excited to discuss with you the specific data problems we're working to solve – from unifying user journey data across multiple touchpoints to creating actionable customer segments that drive growth.

You'll Help Us Answer Questions Like

What behaviors predict our highest-value customers?
How do we measure product adoption across 120,000+ companies and a range of AI features? 
What engagement patterns lead to contract renewals? 

You'll work with data from Mixpanel, MongoDB, Segment, Stripe and more to build a unified view that powers everything from marketing campaigns to product decisions.

This role offers the rare opportunity to shape our entire data strategy while delivering immediate business impact. We'd love to dive deeper into these challenges with you during our conversations.
